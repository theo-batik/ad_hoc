# OVERVIEW:
    # Definition of a class::'BiomassByDrone':
    # used to estimate kelp canopy biomass from a given drone image

# Env. vars
# Image sensor width
# DEGREES_PER_METER

class BiomassByDrone():
    pass

    # Init:
    # Path to raw image

    # Methods:

    # Get metadata from raw image
    # Compute meters-per-pixel ratio
    # Convert raw to binary image (using ImageJ)
    # Produce "canopy coverage map"
    # Save "canopy coverage map" (with metadata)
    # Show "canopy coverage map"
